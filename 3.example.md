# Run a scikit-learn example

The scikit-learn documentation relies heavily on code examples to
demonstrate how to use the package with actual data, typically on
standard public datasets.

All scikit-learn examples are gathered in the [examples/](
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/main/examples)
folder and its subfolders.

They are used to automatically generate the pages of the example
gallery on the project website:

https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html

The goal of this exercise is to get familiar navigating in those
examples and executing them either from the command-line or from
with-in VS Code, leveraging the built-in matplotlib integration.

In particular, we will consider the following example file:

- [examples/inspection/plot_permutation_importance.py](
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/main/examples/inspection/plot_permutation_importance.py)

which renders as:

- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/inspection/plot_permutation_importance.html

Note: how to generate the HTML documentation will be presented later.

## From the command line

```
$ cd scikit-learn
$ ls examples
$ ls examples/inspection
$ python examples/inspection/plot_permutation_importance.py
```

Bug, no graphical output pop-up.
To resolve the bug and have the pop-pup with the new window managed by matplotlib:
Edit plot_permutation_importance.py
At the end of the code, add:
Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.show()


The text output should be displayed directly in the terminal,
while the graphical output will pop-up in a new window managed
by matplotlib. If you have not already installed matplotlib and pandas, you
can do it with conda:

```
$ conda install matplotlib pandas
```

Hint: at any moment use the `pwd` command to find where you are. `pwd` stands
for "Path to Working Directory". For instance here is a typical output one
would get on a Linux machine:

```
$ pwd
/home/YOUR-NAME/code/scikit-learn
```

## From VS Code

- `ctrl-p` "plot permutation importance" then

- `Ctrl-Shift-P` "Run Current File in Python Interactive Window"
